## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Clone the repo. The repo will contain a dotnet core 3.1.1 solution, a docker file to run the container. Run the docker file, run sql server

### Prerequisites

You're going to need Visual Studio, Docker and SQL Server.

## Deployment

Create a Azure account and publish the app from Visual Studio.
Currently unable to deploy to Azure using .Net Core 3.1. I will keep an eye on this [deployment issue](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1/) + [github issue](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements-discussions/issues/118) and update when the SDK becomes available.
